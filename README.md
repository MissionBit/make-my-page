Making an "About Me" Page with GitHub Pages

The goal of this project is to make a personal web page, and to learn more about using GitHub.  We will host our page on GitHub pages, which is a hosting service that allows us to serve our page from a GitHub repository.  


## Some Background Information

### GitHub

**Git** is a tool used for keeping software projects organized, which makes both solo and team development work easier.  

**GitHub** is a free service we'll be using to keep our code safe and help us collaborate. GitHub is like a backup service for your code.  If you make sure to push your code there every class, you won't lose it.  This is very handy for a lot of reasons; if you aren't using the same laptop during every class, or you accidentally delete a file or make a mistake after you've pushed it. When working in groups it also makes it much easier for multiple people to collaborate on the same project.

**GitHub Desktop** is an app on your computer (also known as a "client") which makes it easier to interact with your GitHub repositories from your computer

**repository:** also known as "repo"- a place to keep your code and files

**commit:** save the state of your current project.  GitHub takes a "snapshot" of your files, when you want to save changes

**push:** "push up your code" means to upload to the repository

**pull:** "pull down your code" means to download from the repository

**clone:** "clone down your repo" means to download the same repository to your computer

**git:**  open-source version control software

**open-source:**  refers to something people can use, change, or modify because it is publicly accessible

## 1. Making a GitHub Account

Go to https://github.com/ and sign up for an account.

GitHub won't spam you, but the email address you choose will be associated with your account and by default it may be published along with your code. If you don't want that, go to the Emails section under Account Settings. After you verify your email address there will be an option to "Keep my email address private".

## 2. Making a Repository

Open the GitHub app and sign in. Click the `+` at the top and name your new repository `YOURNAME.github.io`. For example, if your GitHub username is
`pokemon-fan` then the name should be `pokemon-fan.github.io`.


## 3. Adding your Repository to GitHub Desktop

Now open Brackets and press `Opt-Cmd-O` (File -> Open Folder).
Navigate to your home directory by pressing `Shift-Cmd-H`
(or use the pulldown). Choose your repository and then click Open (or
press return).

Press `Cmd-N` (File -> New) to create a new file. Type anything you
want, such as "Hello World", into the window and then press
`Cmd-S` (File -> Save). Choose the name `index.html` and click Save.

Switch back to GitHub with `Cmd-Tab`. You should see the changes you
made. Click on the `+` with arrows icon so that the button says
"Commit and Sync". Type in a quick note about what you did in Summary
and then click "Commit and Sync".

After about 10 minutes, you'll have your own website at
http://YOURNAME.github.io/ - we'll be using this repository throughout
the semester so you can easily show off your projects.
