Making an "About Me" Page with GitHub Pages

The goal of this project is to make a personal web page, and to learn more about using GitHub.  We will host our page on GitHub pages, which is a hosting service that allows us to serve our page from a GitHub repository.  


## Some Background Information

### GitHub
Git is a tool used for keeping software projects organized, which helps to make both individual and team development work easier.  


### Glossary
**version control:** the task of keeping a software system consisting of many versions and configurations well organized
**repository:** also known as "repo"- a place to keep your code and files
**commit:** save the state of your current project.  GitHub takes a "snapshot" of your files, when you want to save changes
**push:**
**pull:**
**clone:** 




Making a Repository
===================

Open the GitHub app and sign in. Click the `+` at the top and name your new repository `YOURNAME.github.io`. For example, if your GitHub username is
`pokemon-fan` then the name should be `pokemon-fan.github.io`.

Now open Brackets and press `Opt-Cmd-O` (File -> Open Folder).
Navigate to your home directory by pressing `Shift-Cmd-H`
(or use the pulldown). Choose your repository and then click Open (or
press return).

Press `Cmd-N` (File -> New) to create a new file. Type anything you
want, such as "Hello World", into the window and then press
`Cmd-S` (File -> Save). Choose the name `index.html` and click Save.

Switch back to GitHub with `Cmd-Tab`. You should see the changes you
made. Click on the `+` with arrows icon so that the button says
"Commit and Sync". Type in a quick note about what you did in Summary
and then click "Commit and Sync".

After about 10 minutes, you'll have your own website at
http://YOURNAME.github.io/ - we'll be using this repository throughout
the semester so you can easily show off your projects.
